        <p class="about">Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.<br>He has three children, and  started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. <br>After The Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the business has been booming ever since.</p>
